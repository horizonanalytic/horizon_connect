## About

Horizon Connect is a secure messaging app that puts privacy and intentional connections first. Unlike other messaging apps, you can only connect with people you meet in person — no phone numbers, no random friend requests.

### Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Signal Protocol encryption for all messages
- **In-Person Key Exchange**: Add contacts via Bluetooth proximity
- **Ephemeral Messages**: Messages disappear after 24 hours by default
- **No Account Required**: No phone number or email needed
- **Zero Metadata**: We don't log who talks to whom
