**Horizon Connect: Secure Chat**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I add a contact?
You must be physically near the person you want to add. Both of you should:
1. Open Horizon Connect
2. Tap "Add Contact"
3. Enable Bluetooth if prompted
4. Select each other from the discovered devices list
5. Confirm the connection on both devices

### Why do I need to be near someone to add them?
This is a security feature. By requiring physical proximity, we ensure you always know exactly who you're connecting with. No random friend requests, no impersonation.

### Can I add someone remotely?
No. Horizon Connect is designed for intentional, verified connections. This is a core privacy feature, not a limitation.

### Are my messages really private?
Yes. All messages are end-to-end encrypted using the Signal Protocol. Not even we can read them. Your encryption keys never leave your device.

### What happens if I lose my phone?
Your encryption keys are stored only on your device. If you lose your phone:
- No one can access your messages without your device passcode/biometrics
- You'll need to re-establish connections with your contacts on a new device
- We cannot recover your messages or keys

### Why do messages disappear?
By default, messages are ephemeral (24 hours) to protect your privacy. You can change this in conversation settings. Persistent messages require both parties to agree.

### Do you store my messages on a server?
Encrypted messages are temporarily stored on our relay server only until they're delivered to the recipient. We cannot decrypt these messages.

### What data do you collect?
Almost nothing. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) for details. We don't collect your phone number, email, contacts, location, or any message content.

## Troubleshooting

### Bluetooth not finding nearby devices
1. Ensure Bluetooth is enabled in iOS Settings
2. Make sure the other person has Horizon Connect open
3. Try moving closer together
4. Restart the app on both devices

### Messages not sending
1. Check your internet connection
2. The recipient may be offline; messages will be delivered when they reconnect
3. Try force-closing and reopening the app

### Push notifications not working
1. Go to iOS Settings > Horizon Connect > Notifications
2. Ensure notifications are enabled
3. Check that "Allow Notifications" is on
